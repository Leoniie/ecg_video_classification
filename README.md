# AML_Task4

The focus of this task is the classification of echocardiography video data, a very noisy but inexpensive and vastly available tool for the diagnostic of heart diseases. In this task we will perform the differential diagnosis of the Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) and the Takostubo Syndrome (TTS). The task is highly challenging for the high dimensionality of the data, low number of samples and high noise level.
